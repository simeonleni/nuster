# To create a MySQL database for your application, follow these steps:

Create a new database named 'nuster' using the following command:
CREATE DATABASE nuster;

Create a new database user named 'nuster' with the password 'NUSTERSERVER' using the following command:
CREATE USER 'nuster'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NUSTERSERVER';

Grant all privileges to the 'nuster' user on the 'nuster'database using the following command:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nuster.* TO 'nuster'@'localhost';

Apply the changes by running the following command:
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Navigate to the application.properties file in your application's resources directory. This file is used to configure your database connection

src>main>resources

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the server for your Java application, navigate to the NusterApplication.java file. This file contains the main class that is used to start the server.


src>main>java>com>server>nuster

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your Java application is well configured, you can run or debug the server from any Java file. When running or debugging the server, you should expect to see output in the terminal.

 


To access the client side of your application, navigate to the directory where the website code is located. From there, you can open the index.html file in your web browser.

src>main>java>com>client
 

If you have the Live Server extension installed in your IDE, you can simply click on the 'Go Live' button to start the web server and view the website in your browser.  



If you encounter any errors while running the code, it may be due to a port conflict or an issue with your database configuration. Check that the server is not trying to access a port that is already in use, and make sure your database is properly configured.

If you are still experiencing issues, send the error code and a screenshot of the error message to me so I can assist you in resolving the issue.
Project Description: This section should describe the project's purpose, and objectives. It should include a brief overview of the problem being solved and the proposed solution.
